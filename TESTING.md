# Chrome Extension Features & Testing Guide

## Core Features Implemented

### 1. Product Page Detection ✅
The extension automatically detects product pages on e-commerce websites using:
- **URL Pattern Matching**: Recognizes specific URL patterns for each site
- **DOM Element Verification**: Confirms presence of product title and image
- **Site-Specific Logic**: Custom selectors for accurate detection on different platforms

**Supported Sites:**
- Amazon (all domains) - Detects `/dp/`, `/gp/product/` URLs
- eBay - Detects `/itm/` URLs  
- Walmart - Detects `/ip/` URLs
- Target - Detects `/p/` URLs
- Etsy - Detects `/listing/` URLs
- Plus 10+ more platforms

### 2. Save Button Injection ✅
When a product page is detected, the extension:
- Creates a styled "Save to Closet" button
- Positions it near the product title using site-specific insertion points
- Applies gradient styling with hover effects
- Includes an icon (+ symbol) for visual clarity

**Button States:**
- **Normal**: Purple gradient with white text
- **Saving**: Gray color with spinning icon animation
- **Saved**: Green color with checkmark icon
- **Error**: Red color with error message

### 3. Product Information Extraction ✅
The extension extracts and saves:
- **Product Title**: Full product name
- **Product Image**: Main product image URL
- **Price**: Current price (handles various formats)
- **URL**: Direct link to the product page
- **Site**: E-commerce platform name
- **Timestamp**: When the product was saved

### 4. Local Storage ✅
All products are stored using Chrome's Storage API:
- No external servers or cloud storage
- Data persists across browser sessions
- Privacy-focused - all data stays on user's device
- Easy to access and manage

### 5. Popup Interface ✅
The extension popup provides:
- **Product Count**: Shows total saved products
- **Product List**: Cards showing image, title, price, and site
- **Quick Actions**: 
  - View button (opens product page)
  - Remove button (deletes individual product)
  - Clear All button (removes all products)
- **Empty State**: Helpful message when no products are saved

### 6. Background Service Worker ✅
Handles:
- Extension lifecycle events
- Storage management
- Message passing between components
- Installation and update logic

## Key Implementation Details

### Manifest V3 Compliance
- Uses latest Chrome extension architecture
- Service worker instead of background page
- Modern permissions system
- Content script injection with proper timing

### Product Detection Algorithm
```javascript
1. Check URL against site-specific patterns
2. Verify title element exists in DOM
3. Verify image element exists in DOM
4. If both present → Product page detected
5. Inject save button near title element
```

### Data Flow
```
Product Page → Content Script → Extract Info → Chrome Storage
                     ↓
              Inject Save Button → User Click → Save Product
                                                      ↓
Extension Popup ← Chrome Storage ← Background Worker
```

### Responsive Design
- Button adapts to different page layouts
- Popup works on all screen sizes
- Mobile-friendly (when Chrome supports extensions on mobile)

- [ ] Close browser
- [ ] Reopen browser
- [ ] Open popup → Products still saved

### Automated Testing (Not Implemented)
For future enhancement, consider adding:
- Unit tests for product detection logic
- Integration tests for storage operations
- E2E tests using Selenium/Puppeteer
- Visual regression tests for UI components

## Known Limitations

1. **Site Coverage**: Only supports whitelisted e-commerce sites
2. **Dynamic Content**: May need page refresh on single-page apps
3. **Rate Limiting**: None currently (could save unlimited products)
4. **Export**: No export to CSV/JSON functionality yet
5. **Categories**: No product categorization or tags
6. **Search**: No search within saved products

## Future Enhancements

Potential features to add:
- [ ] Product categories/tags
- [ ] Search and filter saved products
- [ ] Export to CSV/JSON
- [ ] Price tracking and alerts
- [ ] Share saved products
- [ ] Sync across devices (with user account)
- [ ] Support for more e-commerce sites
- [ ] Wishlist vs. purchased categorization
- [ ] Notes on saved products

## Troubleshooting

### Button Not Appearing
**Symptoms**: Save button doesn't show on product page

**Solutions**:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify you're on a product page (not search results)
3. Refresh the page
4. Check site is in supported list
5. Reinstall extension

### Save Not Working
**Symptoms**: Button click doesn't save product

**Solutions**:
1. Check Chrome storage permissions
2. Look for JavaScript errors in console
3. Try saving different product
4. Clear extension storage and retry

### Popup Not Opening
**Symptoms**: Extension icon doesn't open popup

**Solutions**:
1. Check manifest.json for errors
2. Verify popup.html exists
3. Look for errors in popup console
4. Reload extension

### Products Not Persisting
**Symptoms**: Saved products disappear

**Solutions**:
1. Check Chrome storage quota
2. Verify storage permissions in manifest
3. Check for storage errors in console
4. Don't use incognito mode (storage is session-only)

## Performance Metrics

Expected performance:
- **Detection Time**: < 500ms after page load
- **Save Time**: < 100ms
- **Popup Load**: < 200ms
- **Storage Size**: ~1KB per product
- **Memory Usage**: < 10MB total

## Security Considerations

1. **No External Requests**: All data stays local
2. **Minimal Permissions**: Only storage and activeTab
3. **XSS Protection**: Input sanitization in popup
4. **CSP Compliant**: No inline scripts in HTML
5. **Host Permissions**: Limited to e-commerce sites only

## Browser Compatibility

- ✅ Chrome 88+ (Manifest V3 required)
- ✅ Microsoft Edge 88+
- ✅ Brave (Chromium-based)
- ❌ Firefox (different extension API)
- ❌ Safari (different extension system)
